# purescript-routing-bob

Let me introduce Bob The Router (he is nearly a pendulum bob) - simple (but usable) example of partial bidirectional ~~bobs~~ routes generator based on __purescript-boomerang__ and purescript generics.

## Installation

```shell
bower install purescript-routing-bob
```

## Limitations

It is called `bob`, because it contains arbitrary, nonconfigurable and partial routes generators based on `Generic` instances.
When it will grow up maybe it will became `purescript-boomerang-routing`.

Currently you can generate routes only for some subset of purescript types - if you want extend this set and have proposition how to encode others I'm really open to merge pull requests.
